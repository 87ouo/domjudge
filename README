Further reading
---------------

For more information on installation and requirements see the
documentation under the doc/ directory. Run `make docs` there
to create HTML and PDF versions of the available documentation.
You will need `linuxdoc` for that to work (this is normally in
the linuxdoc-tools package/rpm) and a reasonably complete LaTeX
installation.

The documentation is also available online at the DOMjudge
homepage (see below).
