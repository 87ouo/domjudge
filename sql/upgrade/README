MySQL upgrade scripts
=====================

This directory contains MySQL upgrade scripts that can be applied to
upgrade the DOMjudge MySQL database structure and data to a newer
version.

These upgrade scripts have names 'upgrade_<from>_<to>.sql', with
<from> and <to> the respective versions of DOMjudge they apply to.
Each script contains a check that verifies if it should be applied and
which fails if the upgrade was applied already. The scripts should be
applied in order; this can be done manually, but it is probably easier
to use the command 'dj-setup-database upgrade'.

Upgrading to a new minor/major version is supported. Usually, there
will not be database changes between bugfix releases of any given
branch, so the upgrade_A.B.C_X.Y.0.sql script will be sufficient also
for X.Y.1, X.Y.2 etc. If such a change between bugfixes is necessary,
a separate upgrade_X.Y.0_X.Y.N.sql script will be provided.
