 * Output public scoreboard static HTML to standard out.

 * DOMjudge web interface, but without automatic refresh, and
 * with no links to subpages. It does depend on the style.css.
 *
 * Use this when you want to generate a HTML page for the public
 * scoreboard, e.g. for the contest final results, or to use as
 * a very scalable public view. In the latter case, do something
 * like this:
 *
 * while true; do ./static_scoreboard.php > scores.html; sleep 30; done
 *
 * $Id$
