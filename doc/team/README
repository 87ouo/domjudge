DOMjudge team manuals
---------------------

These manuals for teams automatically incorporate DOMjudge configuration
items. Make sure to rebuild them after you've made changes to your setup,
so teams don't get misinformation.

As many things are configurable, we advise to redact the manuals to your
specific situation, e.g. by removing unused/disabled features, before
distributing them to the teams.
