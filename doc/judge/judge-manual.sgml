<chapt>DOMjudge Overview
<p>

DOMjudge is a system for running a programming contest, like the ACM
regional and world championship programming contests.

This means that teams are on-site and have a fixed time period (mostly
5 hours) and one computer to solve a number of problems (mostly 6-10).
Problems are solved by writing a program in one of the allowed
languages, that reads input according to the problem input
specification and writes the correct, corresponding output.

The judging is done by submitting the source code of the solution to
the jury. There the jury system automatically compiles and runs the
program and compares the program output with the expected output.

This software can be used to handle the submission and judging during
such contests. It also handles feedback to the teams and communication
on problems (clarification requests). It has webinterfaces for the
jury, the teams (their submissions and clarification requests) and the
public (scoreboard).

<chapt>General
<p>
The jury interface is accessed through a web browser. The first page
shows a list of various overviews, and the most important of those are
also included in the menu bar at the top. The menu bar will refresh
occasionally to allow for new information to be presented. It also has
the current `official' contest time in the top-right corner.

Most pieces of information are clickable and bring up a new page with
details. Many items also have tooltips that reveal extra information
when the mouse is hovered over them. Problem, language and team pages
have lists with corresponding submissions for that problem, language
or team.

The most important pages are `Submissions': the list of submitted
solutions made by teams, sorted by newest first, and `Scoreboard': the
canonical overview of current standings.

<sect>Judges and Administrators
<p>
The DOMjudge system discerns between <em>judges</em> and <em>administrators</em>
(admins). An administrator is responsible for the technical side of DOMjudge:
installation and keeping it running. The jury web interface may be used by both.

Depending on configuration, there may either be a separate administrator view or
one is shared between judges and administrators. In the first case you will not
have access to the admin-specific options. In the latter, you may see
options directed at admins, like options to edit or delete data. Be careful not
to touch these options unless an administrator agreed for you to do so.

<sect>Scoreboard
<p>
The scoreboard is the most important view on the contest.

Before the contest has started, the scoreboard will not display
anything (or, the standings from the previous contest, if any). It
will become available in the first second after the contest started.

It is possible to freeze the scoreboard at a given time, commonly
one hour before the contest ends, to keep the last hour interesting
for all. From that time on, the public and team scoreboard will not
be updated anymore (the jury scoreboard will) and indicate that they
are frozen. It will be unfrozen at a specified time, or by a button
click in the jury interface. Note that the way freezing works, a
submission from before the freeze and judged after may still update
the scoreboard even when frozen.

The problem headings can take the colours of balloons associated with
them, when set.

Nearly everything on the scoreboard can be clicked to reveal more
detailed information about the item in question: team names, specific
submissions and problem headers.

<chapt>Before the contest
<p>

Before the contest starts, a number of things will need to be
configured by the administrator. You can check that information,
such as the problem set(s) and time limits, contest start- and
end time, the time at which the scoreboard will be frozen and
unfrozen all from the links from the front page.

Note that multiple contests can be defined, with corresponding
problem sets, for example a practice session and the real contest.

<sect>Problems and languages
<p>

The problem sets are listed under `Problems'. It is possible to change
whether teams can submit solutions for that problem (using the toggle
switch `allow submit'). If disallowed, submissions for that problem
will be rejected, but more importantly, teams will not see that
problem on the scoreboard! Disallow judge will make DOMjudge accept
submissions, but leave them queued; this is useful in case an
unexpected problem shows up with one of the problems. Timelimit is the
maximum number of seconds a submission for this problem is allowed to
run before a `TIMELIMIT' response is given (multiplied by the language
factor).

The `Languages' overview is quite the same. It has a timefactor
column; submissions in a language that has time factor 2 will be
allowed to run twice the time that has been specified under Problems.
This is needed to compensate for slowness in some languages, e.g.
Java.


<sect>Practice Session
<p>
If your contest has a test session or practice contest, use it also as
a general rehearsal of the jury system: judge test submissions as you
would do during the real contest and answer incoming clarification
requests.


<chapt>During the contest
<p>

<sect>Monitor teams
<p>
Under the Teams menu option, you can get a general impression of the
status of each team: a traffic light will show either of the
following:
<descrip>
<tag>gray  </tag>the team has not (yet) connected to the web interface at all;
<tag>red   </tag>the team has connected but not submitted anything yet;
<tag>yellow</tag>one or more submissions have been made, but none correct;
<tag>green </tag>the team has made at least one submission that has
                 been judged as correct.
</descrip>

This is especially useful during the practice session, where it is
expected that every team can make at least one correct submission. A
team with any other colour near the end of the session might be having
difficulties.
 

<sect>Judging Submissions
<p>

<sect1>Flow of submitted solutions 
<p>

The flow of an incoming submission is as follows.

<enum>
<item>Team submits solution. It will either be rejected after basic
      checks, or accepted and stored as a <em>submission</em>.
<item>The first available autojudger compiles, runs and checks the
      submission. The outcome and outputs are stored as a
      <em>judging</em> of this submission.
<item>If verification is not required, the result is automatically
      recorded and the team can view the result and the scoreboard is
      updated (unless after the scoreboard freeze). A judge can
      optionally inspect the submission and judging and mark it
      verified.
<item>If verification is required, a judge inspects the judging. Only
      after it has been approved (marked as <em>verified</em>) will
      the result be visible outside the jury room.
</enum>

<sect1>Submission judging status codes
<p>
The interface for jury and teams shows the status of a submission with
a code.
<descrip>
<tag>QUEUED/PENDING</tag>submission accepted and awaiting an autojudger to process it *;
<tag>JUDGING       </tag>an autojudger is currently compiling/running/testing the submission *;
<tag>TOO-LATE      </tag>submission accepted but submitted after the contest ends;
<tag>CORRECT       </tag>submission correct, problem solved;
<tag>COMPILER-ERROR</tag>the compiler gave an error while compiling the program;
<tag>TIMELIMIT     </tag>program execution time exceeded the time defined for the problem;
<tag>RUN-ERROR     </tag>a kind of problem while running the program occurred, for example
                         segmentation fault, division by zero or exitcode unequal to 0.
<tag>NO-OUTPUT     </tag>there was no output at all from the program;
<tag>WRONG-ANSWER</tag> the output of the program did not exactly match the expected output;
</descrip>
* in the team interface a submission will only show as PENDING to
prevent leaking information of problem timelimits. The jury can see
whether a submission is QUEUED or JUDGING. In case of required
verification, a submission will show as PENDING to the team until the
judging has been verified.

Under the Submissions menu, you can see all submitted solutions, with
the newest one at the top. Click on a submission id (a number starting
with <em>s</em>, e.g. s123) for more details about the submission
(team name, submittime etc) and the judging(s) for it. Click on a
result code to jump straight to the judging details (runtime, outputs,
diff with testdata, diff with previous submission).

Under the submission details the source filename can be clicked to inspect
the source code. If the team has submitted something for this problem before,
a diff output between the current and previous submission is also available
there.

A submission can have multiple judgings, but only one valid one at any
time. Multiple judgings happen with rejudging, see <ref id="rejudging"
name="Rejudging">.

<sect1>Rejudging <label id="rejudging">
<p>
In some situations it is necessary to rejudge a submission. This means
that the submission will re-enter the flow as if it had not been
judged before. The submittime will be the original time, but the
program will be compiled, run and tested again.

This can be useful when there was some kind of problem: a compiler
that was broken and later fixed, or testdata that was incorrect and
later changed. When a submission is rejudged, the old judging data is
kept but marked as `invalid'.

You can rejudge a single submission by pressing the `Rejudge' button
when viewing the submission details. It is also possible to rejudge
all submissions for a given language, problem, team or judgehost; to
do so, go to the page of the respective language, problem, team or
judgehost, press the `Rejudge all' button and confirm.

Submissions that have been marked as `CORRECT' will not be rejudged.

Teams will not get explicit notifications of rejudgings, other than a
potentially changed outcome of their submissions. It might be desirable
to combine rejudging with a clarification to the team or all teams
explaining what has been rejudged and why.

<sect>Clarification Requests
<p>
Communication between teams and jury happens through Clarification
Requests. Everything related to that happens under the Clarifications
menu item.

<p>
Teams can use their web interface to send a clarification request to
the jury. The jury can send a response to that team specifically, or
send it to all teams. The latter is done to ensure that all teams have
the same information about the problem set. The jury can also send a
clarification that does not correspond to a specific request. These
will be termed `general clarifications'.

<p>
Under Clarifications, three lists are shown: new clarifications,
answered clarifications and general clarifications. It lists the team
login, the time and an excerpt. Click the excerpt for details about
that clarification request.

<p>
Every incoming clarification request will initially be marked as
unanswered. The menu bar shows the number of unanswered requests. A
request will be marked as answered when a response has been sent.
Additionally it's possible to mark a clarification request as answered
with the button that can be found when viewing the request. The latter
can be used when the request has been dealt with in some other way,
for example by sending a general message to all teams.

<p>
Answering a clarification request happens by putting the text in the
input box under the request text. The original text is quoted. You can
choose to either send it to the team that requested the clarification,
or to all teams. In the latter case, make sure you phrase it in such a
way that it's understandable by itself, since the other teams do not
know what the original question was.


<chapt>After the contest
<p>
Once the contest is over, the system will still accept submissions but
will not judge them anymore. Teams will see this as a `TOO-LATE'
response.

<p>
If the scoreboard was frozen, it will remain frozen until the time set
as unfreeze time, as seen under Contests. It is possible to publish
the final standings at any given moment by pressing the `unfreeze
scoreboard now' button under contests.

<p>
There's not much more to be done after the contest has ended. The
administrator will need to take care of backing up all system data and
submissions, and the awards ceremony can start.
